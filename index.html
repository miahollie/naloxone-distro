                        <p>Atlantic County, despite its high rate of drug fatalities, is home to only a few dozen pharmacies that offer overdose-reversing drugs for free, according to a recent analysis by the New York City News Service.</p> 
                            
                        <p>For every 100,000 residents who lived in Atlantic County last year, 92.5 of them died due to a drug-related overdose, the highest rate out of any county in the state.</p>

                        <p>Only 21 of the county's pharmacies participate in New Jersey's new naloxone program, which allows pharmacies to provide the medication to anyone over 14 years old for free, regardless of the person's healthcare coverage status.</p> 

                        <p>Naloxone, commonly known by its trade name Narcan, is a drug that reverses overdoses in people with opioids in their system, according to the New Jersey Department of Human Services. The drug can be administered via injection or nasal spray.</p>

                        </script>

                        <p>Atlantic County residents are not limited to only receiving naloxone at pharmacies, according to Brian Wilson, program coordinator for drug and alcohol abuse at the Atlantic County Department of Human Services.</p>

                        <p>First responders, mobile outreach treatment programs, reentry programs and law enforcement agencies provide free Narcan, he said.</p>

                        <p>The state-pharmacy partnership program, however, is supposed to help New Jerseyians feel more comfortable requesting substance abuse assistance, according to Department of Human Services Commissioner Sarah Adelman.</p>

                        <p>"Making naloxone accessible and available for free and anonymously in pharmacies eliminates the most common barriers to the life-saving medication," she said in a statement. </p>
